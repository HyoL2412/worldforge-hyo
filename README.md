## 📌 About

This project is a fully AI-assisted repository built for learning and experimenting with Git.  
Everything here — from structure to content — was generated and committed by AI,  
under the guidance of a curious developer who's just getting started.

## 🛠️ Purpose

- Practice `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `rebase`, and conflict resolution
- Learn how to work with GitHub repositories from local to remote
- Test `.gitignore` rules and Visual Studio C++ workflows

## 🚀 Status

Initial commit only.  
Main focus: understanding Git, not the app functionality (yet!)
